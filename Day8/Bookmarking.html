    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p id="html">HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Itâ€™s a combination of Hypertext, which defines the link between web pages, and Markup language, which is used to define the text document within tags to structure web pages. This language is used to annotate text so that machines can understand and manipulate it accordingly. HTML is human-readable and uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. This guide will help you understand the workings of HTML and explain it with examples.</p>

    <h1>Java Script</h1>
    <p id="java">JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.

        JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. </p>
